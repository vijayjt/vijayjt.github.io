In this post we will discuss using WASMPlugin.
The WebAssembly for Proxies ABI Specification provides an application binary interface specification for proxies - while originally developed for Envoy it is not envoy specific. There are SDKs for C++, Go, Rust and AssemblyScript itself.
We will be using the Go SDK for Proxy-Wasm, which uses TinyGo - mainly because I don&amp;rsquo;t know Rust and I have not written C++ for a long time &amp;#x1f604;</description></item><item><title>Istio Envoy Filters with Lua</title><link>https://vijayjt.github.io/posts/istio-envoy-filters-lua/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jan 2024 11:05:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vijayjt.github.io/posts/istio-envoy-filters-lua/</guid><description>Istio Envoy Filters provides a way customise Envoy&amp;rsquo;s behaviour. They can be useful when you have a requirement that cannot be fulfilled out of the box by Istio.
Warning
When using Envoy Filters we are using low-level APIs that can change between Istio versions. It is therefore important that you have robust tests in place and review change logs/release notes carefully for changes that may break your filters.
Envoy itself has a number of built-in filters but we are specifically going to talk about Lua filters which allows Lua code to be executed during both the request and response flows.</description></item></channel></rss>
